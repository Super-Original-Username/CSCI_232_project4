Overview: Dynamic change-making algorithm. Also uses jUnit for tests to make sure it works proper-like.
Modified version of the greedy change-making algorithm from lab 7
Uses JUnit 5 for all tests

How to use: Run JUnit tests as usual. If you want to change the init ("in" in the test class) value being entered, do
so from the seeIfItWorks test in tests.java. You'll also need to edit the items added to the arrayList, as those are
used in the comparison when running the test. If you only want to check the output of the program, don't worry about
the arrayList, you should just be able to edit the "in" variable in that test, and JUnit should spit out the error,
with both the expected and actual outputs.

Sorry if most of the commits are from me (Ethan). There wasn't really a whole lot to change from lab 7, so I ended up
doing the majority of the commits when we met up to work on this.
